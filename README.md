# Gender_and_age_detection_system
In these project I made gender and age detection system using Jupyter Notebook can be implemented using machine learning algorithms and computer vision techniques. The system can be trained on a dataset of labeled images to learn patterns and features that distinguish between males and females and estimate their ages based on their facial features.
